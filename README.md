# Authentication Latency Experiment

This repository contains the source code for a small experimental study that measures authentication latency under different authentication routines with increasing computational complexity.

## Description
The experiment compares three authentication routines:
Simple authentication
Lightweight cryptographic authentication using hashing
Heavy authentication with repeated hashing

The purpose of the experiment is to demonstrate how increasing authentication complexity affects authentication latency in a controlled and simplified environment.

## How to run
1. Ensure Python 3 is installed
2. Run the script using:
   python3 auth_latency.py

## Notes
This experiment is intentionally lightweight and does not aim to represent real-world cloud authentication systems.
